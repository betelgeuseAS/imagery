### Frontend
The backend uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [MUI](https://mui.com/) created by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Backend
The backend uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Database
The project uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. You can read about installation and use [here](https://metanit.com/nosql/mongodb/).
[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used to manage the database.
You can also use the official [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) graphical client to work with MongoDB.  

**Connection to the DB:**
```text
MONGO_URI = mongodb://localhost:27017/imagery
# Or
MONGO_URI = mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/imagery


# "mongodb://localhost:27017/" - standard path.
# "/imagery" - the name of the database.
```

The database and collections are created automatically when the project is launched, if they are specified in the models and do not already exist.
